I am Chanhyuk (David) Lee, a Master's student at KAIST School of Computing. I'm currently working in [VL Lab](http://vllab.kaist.ac.kr), which is led by Prof. [Seunghoon Hong](https://maga33.github.io/). Before joining the lab, I received my Bachelor's degree from KAIST in a double major of Computer Science and Chemistry.

I'm widely interested in how complex model can interact with the real world. I'm currently working on model fusion via aligning parameters and representation. Ultimate goal of the work is building large models in bottom-up way with limited resources. Tasks for this goal includes works such as model fusion, knowledge transfer and multi-task learning.

<!-- ## Research

### AdaRank: Adaptive Rank Pruning for Enhanced Model Merging
**Chanhyuk Lee**, Jiho Choi, Chanryeol Lee, Donggyun Kim, Seunghoon Hong  
*arXiv Preprint*, 2025  
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22178) | [code](https://github.com/david3684/AdaRank)

We propose an adaptive model merging framework that dynamically selects optimal singular directions to eliminate cross-task interference and achieve near fine-tuned performance.

### Revisiting Weight Averaging for Model Merging
Jiho Choi, Donggyun Kim, **Chanhyuk Lee**, Seunghoon Hong  
*arXiv Preprint*, 2025  
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12153) | [code](https://github.com/JH-GEECS/CART)

We revisit classical weight averaging appoach for merging fine-tuned models with perspective on spectral components of task vectors. -->
